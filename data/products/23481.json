Plus, brand-new art versions of some of Dueling’s most famous cards, from Red-Eyes Black Dragon and Dark Magician Girl to Harpie’s Feather Duster and Raigeki. With 400 cards in the set, this Tin doesn’t just have something for everyone, it’s got a whole lot of somethings!\r\n\u003cbr\u003eMeanwhile, the 50 Quarter Century Secret Rare cards in the set are a trip down memory lane, showcasing iconic monsters and imagery from decades of Dueling.
