The former is used to put creatures into the graveyard and the latter can then bring them into play. With this combo, Selden is able to use his creatures to react to an opponent's threats. The deck also contains over twenty creatures, many of which have an effect when they enter play or perform some other useful function, such as the Spike Weaver. Unlike many similar decks, Selden's dips into blue, primarily for Lobotomy. He said this was the key to many of his victories."

While creatures like Plague Spitter wiped out his opponent's smaller creatures, more ferocious beasts like Flametongue Kavu aggressively cleared the board of larger threats.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlex Borteh, Finalist—\u003c/strong\u003eAlex Borteh's monoblue combo deck contained twelve 1-toughness creatures. These helped hold the board until his Static Orb—Opposition combo could lock down his opponents' permanents—clearing the way for a horde of Merfolk that pour through for the victory.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAntoine Ruel, Semifinalist—\u003c/strong\u003eAntoine Ruel's blue-black-red control deck survived the pressure in the early game with its almost overwhelming card-drawing capability.

Shortly thereafter, Tomcani's hasted big creatures pounded opponents' life totals to dust."

The 19-year-old Koln, Germany native played a red-artifact deck that contained more than 30 artifacts. He used those artifacts to quickly generate huge amounts of mana, with which he could play a big creature like Masticore or Covetous Dragon. He would then finish his opponent with a well-timed Wildfire."

Hacker said his deck was well set up to defeat his opponents with its twenty-something aggressive creatures—including a number of shadow and en-Kor creatures. Unlike traditional white weenie decks, which rely on Armageddon as a major threat card, Hacker's deck used Cataclysm, which he feels better complements the use of Empyrial Armor."

Ruel credits his teammate Laurent Pagorek for the deck that he calls \"AK-Go.\" The deck, which Ruel played to a 5-1 record during the Standard portion of the tournament, relies on card drawing (most notably Accumulated Knowledge), or \"AK\" for short), countermagic (\"Go,\" for short), red for board control, and Nether Spirits for the win."

Tomcani then proved that his run was no fluke by working his way up to the quarterfinals, where he lost to Alex Borteh in a close five-game match. Tomcani played a version of \"Fires,\" the green-red deck that defined much of this year's metagame. Tomcani's version, which splashed black, follows the normal Fires archetype of playing cheap creatures followed by Fires of Yavimaya and big creatures like Blastoderm or Spiritmonger."

The deck used blue not for countermagic, but for cards like Careful Study and Mental Note, which help the deck reach threshold more quickly, and for Wonder in the graveyard, which allows the deck's pumped-up threshold creatures to fly."

This deck tried to get out lots of Squirrel tokens with Squirrel Nest before using Opposition to tie up the opponent's creatures and mana. Han How won quite a few games using some tricky sideboarding, such as pulling out his enchantments and bringing in more beatdown cards like Flametongue Kavu and Roar of the Wurm. Besides being a top Magic player, Han How is also as student at Bandar Utama College in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."

The white-blue-green \"Wake\" deck is named after the powerful enchantment that's the heart of the deck. Once Mirari's Wake is in play, the deck produces more mana, draws two more cards, counters more spells, and makes more Soldiers than opponents can possibly handle. Zink had help from fellow German and 2002-2003 Player of the Year Kai Budde in adapting the \"Wake\" deck to the post-\u003cem\u003eEighth Edition\u003c/em\u003e environment."

With over $130,000 in career winnings and a Pro Tour championship on his resume, \"The Hump\" advanced to the Worlds semifinals for the second year in a row where he lost to eventual champion Daniel Zink. The blue-green madness deck he played has been a Standard mainstay for more than a year. It revolves around \u003cem\u003eTorment\u003c/em\u003e madness cards like Basking Rootwalla and Circular Logic, together with discard-enablers like Aquamoeba and Wild Mongrel. Humpherys, who recently earned his Ph.D. from MIT, credits this version of the deck to Norway's Sigurd Eskeland."

The twenty-eight-year-old communications and computer science student nicknamed his deck \"Herbert Wise\" after the famous H.P. Lovecraft work \"Herbert Wise—Reanimator.\" Winning with this deck is a two-step process: Step 1. Use Entomb or Buried Alive to quickly get daunting creatures into the graveyard. Step 2. Bring the creature back to life with Zombify or Doomed Necromancer. The mostly black deck also uses Burning Wish to find just the right answers to deal with opponents' plans."

The twenty-two-year-old student from Weinheim, Germany, says the inspiration for the deck came from trying to give the typical Goblin tribe something to do in the midgame. He achieved this by adding black to the deck for Patriarch's Bidding, which brings every Goblin in the graveyard back to play. And with cards like Goblin Warchief and Siege-Gang Commander, those Goblins have haste and bring friend with them! A resolved Patriarch's Bidding is usually game over."
