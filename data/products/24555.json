From Chaos Angel to Kashtira Fenrir, from Number C104: Umbral Horror Masquerade to Mementoal Tecuhtlica – Combined Creation, and many, many, more, this is the best chance you’ll have at getting today’s meta-relevant cards for your Decks.\r\n\u003cbr\u003eIn each 5-card pack, 4 slots pull from that main card pool, in a variety of rarities, from the normal Super, Ultra, and Secret Rares, to Starlight, Platinum Secret, and the unique “Prismatic”-style Ultimate \u0026 Collector’s Rares found only in Rarity Collection sets.\r\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd, like Quarter Century Bonanza \u0026 Quarter Century Stampede, the 5th card in each pack comes from a different card pool than the rest of the pack.
