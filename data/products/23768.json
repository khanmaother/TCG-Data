This Level 12 Synchro isn’t just a Synchro Monster, it’s a Synchro Monstrosity! Once per turn, this Dragon can negate any effect activated by your opponent on the field. And when it does, it also consumes the negated effect to gain 1000 Attack Points for the turn. But wait – there’s more! It also shields your Graveyard so that your opponent can’t banish any of the cards located there. And in the unlikely event your opponent can overcome its 3500 Attack Points, you can just Summon another LIGHT Dragon monster from your Graveyard – even a Blue-Eyes White Dragon!\r\n\u003cbr\u003eA new Synchro needs a new Tuner! Neo Kaiser Sea Horse is a Level 4 Tuner that gives you instant access to the tools you need, by Special Summoning itself from your hand, and adjusting the Level of any Tuner (even itself!) by +/- 1. This gives you maximum flexibility for whatever’s the best monster to Synchro Summon. And it can access your “Blue-Eyes” monsters from your Deck by sending them directly to your Graveyard, for easy revival!\r\n\u003cbr\u003eMaiden of White is another powerful addition to this Deck. Every time this elusive Tuner is targeted (including by your own effects!), you can Summon Blue-Eyes White Dragon or any Level 1 LIGHT Tuner from your Graveyard. And whenever you Summon Blue-Eyes White Dragon, you can Summon Maiden of White from your Graveyard. And unlike most effects, Maiden of White never banishes herself after using this effect, so you can use it continuously throughout the Duel.\r\n\u003cbr\u003ePlus the very first Link Monster for your “Blue-Eyes” Deck, a brand new Xyz Monster, and so much more!\r\n\u003cbr\u003eThe Deck is packed with the cards that any “Blue-Eyes” Duelist needs for their Deck, like Blue-Eyes Alternative White Dragon, Blue-Eyes Jet Dragon, and even 3 copies of Sage with Eyes of Blue! It also has incredible cards like Nibiru the Primal Being, Ash Blossom \u0026 Joyous Spring, Infinite Impermanence, Effect Veiler, and more!\r\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd since it’s our 25th Anniversary, of course we’re including a little Quarter Century sparkle. A small number of Decks will have 1 of 3 cards – Maiden of White, Wishes for Eyes of Blue, or Blue-Eyes Ultimate Spirit Dragon – as a Quarter Century Secret Rare.\r\n\r\n\u003cbr\u003eStructure Deck: Blue-Eyes White Destiny comes with 50 cards:\r\n\u003cbr\u003e5 Ultra Rares (3 of which have a small chance of being Quarter Century \u003cbr\u003eSecret Rares instead of Ultra Rare)\r\n\u003cbr\u003e3 Super Rares\r\n\u003cbr\u003e42 Commons"
